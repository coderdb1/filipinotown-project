                <p><b>Filipino Town</b> have emerged in the New York City metropolitan area, located in <b>Woodside, Queens</b> in addition to smaller Filipino American subenclaves developing throughout the metropolitan region.<p>Here in the East, the first substantial immigration of Filipinos started with the 1965 Immigration Act that removed racial barriers. The first immigrants to the New York area consisted mainly of professionals--doctors, nurses, other medical personnel, engineers, and accountants. Thousands of nurses and medical school graduates were recruited during those years as exchange scholars. After a few years, these professionals converted their temporary visas to immigrant visas and eventually became naturalized U.S. citizens. They then were able to sponsor their immediate relatives to become immigrants under the family reunification provision. Thus, the initial community was diversified and now encompasses Filipinos with various levels of education, skill, and legal status. The presence of a Filipino community and the United Nations in New York continue to draw Filipinos to this area. The U.N. and its foreign missions are a potential source of diplomatic status for Filipinos wishing to remain here, as diplomatic status are granted to U.N. employees-- about 60% of the U.N.'s support staff are Filipino. With the years of repression and economic deprivation under Ferdinand Marcos, and the continuing problems in the Philippines, this trend of steady immigration remains today.</p>
                <p><b>Woodside, Queens</b> is known for its concentration of Filipinos in Woodside's 85,000 residents, about 13,000 are of Filipino background, comprising 15% of Woodside's population.<p>Organizations: For many years, New York Filipino community organizations have been mostly social in character. The majority of them are paper organizations that hold an annual dinner-dance or an occasional beauty pageant. Most Filipino groups are members of an umbrella organization called Philippine Communities Executive Council. Organizations that focus on providing social services to Filipinos are very few, with the exception of the Philippine Center for Immigrant Rights which offers lawyer referrals and information on legal issues. Around 80% of Filipinos are Roman Catholics, and in New York there is only a small number of Filipino churches. As a whole, Filipinos attend worship at neighborhood churches and do not actively participate in after-service programs. There also has been a progressive presence in the community. Since the early 1970s a number of organizations and issue-oriented associations have worked on immigrant rights, discrimination in the workplace, defense against wrongful prosecution, as well as issues related to the struggle for democracy in the Philippines. Among these organizations are the Union of Democratic Filipinos (KDP), the Campaign for Democracy and Independence in the Philippines (CAMDI), and the Movement for a Free Philippines.</p>
                <p>Filipino restaurants dominate the area, as well as several freight delivery and remittance centers scattered throughout the neighborhood. Other Filipino-owned businesses including professional services (medical, dental, optical), driving schools, beauty salons, immigration services, and Filipino video rental establishments are present in the community.</p>
                <p>Along the IRT Flushing Line (7 train), known colloquially as the Orient Express, the 69th Street station serves as the gateway to Queens' largest Little Manila. This area attracts many local Filipinos and non-Filipinos alike and from neighboring places on Long Island. The coverage of Little Manila is along Roosevelt Avenue, between 58th and 74th Streets. Elsewhere in Queens, Filipinos are also concentrated in Jackson Heights and Elmhurst. There are also smaller Filipino communities in Jamaica, Queens and parts of Brooklyn. The Benigno Aquino Triangle is located on Hillside Avenue in Hollis, Queens to commemorate the slain Filipino political leader and to recognize the large Filipino American population in the area.</p>
                <p>In February 2008, the Bayanihan <b>FilipinoTown</b> Community opened its doors in Woodside, a project spearheaded by the Philippine Forum. The Philippine Forum also hosts the annual Bayanihan Cultural Festival at the Hart Playground in September in commemoration of Filipino American History Month.</p></div>
